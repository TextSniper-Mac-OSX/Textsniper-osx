## What is TextSniper?  

**TextSniper** is an innovative **screen text extraction tool for macOS** that lets you instantly grab and convert text from anywhere on your screen. Whether it‚Äôs a scanned document, an image, a locked PDF, or a paused video frame, TextSniper recognizes the text and copies it directly to your clipboard ‚Äî ready for immediate use.  

Instead of wasting time retyping or taking screenshots, TextSniper uses powerful **optical character recognition (OCR)** technology to capture and convert text within seconds. Its simple design allows users to drag across a region of the screen, and the app automatically extracts all visible text in that area.  

TextSniper works offline, protecting your privacy by processing all OCR tasks locally on your Mac. It supports **multiple languages**, making it a versatile tool for professionals, students, researchers, and content creators. Whether you‚Äôre copying code snippets, saving quotes, or digitizing printed text, TextSniper transforms tedious manual typing into a quick, one-step process.  

Optimized for **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)**, TextSniper delivers lightning-fast recognition while consuming minimal system resources. It stays accessible in your macOS menu bar, always ready to capture text whenever you need it ‚Äî cleanly, instantly, and efficiently.
